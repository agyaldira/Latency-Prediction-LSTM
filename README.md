# Latency Prediction using LSTM
Latency is the time required to transmit and process data, high latency can have a negative impact on business and users. Knowing the magnitude of latency in the future is crucial to take preventive actions when the latency spikes occur.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is the most advanced forecasting method (Korstanje, 2021) wich can solve problems that arise in Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) such as long-term dependency problem and vanishing gradients.
